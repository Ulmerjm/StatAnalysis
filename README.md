# StatAnalysis
Simple methods for determining statistically significant trends in large data sets.

The greater goal of this library is to support the input of large data sets and efficiently find the most statistcally significant pairs of data and outputting these trends in a presentation ready format using both exsisting python libraries and powerful data processing tools such as Tableau. Further functionality goals of this project will include detailed analysis of the effect of 2 or more independent variables on a subject dependant variable.

Final implementations will achieve some level of smart selection on the softwares part to assist analysts and other users to more quickly narrow down potential trends.
